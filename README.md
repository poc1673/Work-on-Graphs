### Week 1:

* Review theory for neural networks:
 + Basic principles of neural networks.
 + Structure of networks (RNN, et cetera).
 + Review of graph convolutional neural networks.

* Graph embeddings.
* Review of use of convolutions and graph theory.
* Tensorflow ML exercise #1: Fit nested linear regression.
* Tensorflow ML exercise #2: Fit 2 stage migration matrix model.
* Basic visualization/classification tasks on graphs.

* Read Link Based Learning - Lu Getoor - 2003
* Read Hammond paper on spectral graph theory *with* intention of identifying key points, not completeness.
* Employ simple machine learning on the graph structure to try to group data.

### Week 2:

1. Read Semi-Supervised Classification on Graph Convolutional Networks - Kipf Welling - 2017.
2. Replicate their results using Tensorflow 2.0 (original implementation used earlier version).
